# PythonQuizzer
This python code will read from a pre-existing excel spreadsheet (the one that comes with the repository), and will quiz you based on the input. Every spreadsheet is another quiz you can use/make. Be sure to follow the format in the spreadsheet (the headers aren't important, the code will always skip to the second line regardless. Keep this in mind).
